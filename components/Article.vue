            On Tuesday, April 19, 2022, in Studio A of the Pavarotti Music
            Center, professional jazz musician, saxophonist, flutist, professor,
            director of Sedajazz Music School, a publishing house and agency
            from Valencia (Spain), held a one-day educational jazz workshop for
            Mostar Rock School students and United World College students in
            Mostar.
          </p>
          <p class="content-part">
            Mostar Rock School, during its 10 years of continuous work, strives
            to provide its students with opportunities to learn and make music
            with world-renowned musicians, masters of their instrument, those
            who have theoretical and practical skills in this art; especially
            those who are willing to selflessly share this knowledge with young
            people, and who have dedicated their artistic and professional work
            to it, such as Francisco Angel Blanco Latino.
          </p>
          <p class="content-part">
            This Latino’s gift to our students – the jazz workshop – began with
            a personal presentation – his improvisation on soprano saxophone,
            after which Latino introduced us to his thirty years-long work with
            young people in his Sedajazz music school. As Latino says –
            improvisation, as the main element of jazz music, is an unknown, but
            also exciting terrain – where you never know what you will come
            across, and that is the charm of this genre.
          </p>
          <p class="content-part">
            After a short introductory part, Latino invited young musicians to
            join him. It started as a domino effect – one by one; from a flute
            in a dialogue with soprano saxophone to guitar, bass guitar, vocals,
            drums, keyboards, mandolin, violins, cello, alto saxophone, joined
            by even one young guslar, and the audience who rhythmically
            supported the whole section by clapping. The participants of the
            workshop created a true Big Band with Latino!

            One of the main topics of the workshop was “How to be a good
            improviser in jazz?”. In the first theoretical part of the six-hour
            intensive workshop, Latino gave answers to many questions, e.g. How
            to make interesting melodies, how to practice scales with numbers,
            and, how to do a “musical dialogue” (group improvisation). He also
            briefly commented on the history of jazz, its connection with other
            genres, and its basic musical characteristics. The participants of
            the workshop also did listening and transposition exercises, as well
            as exercises of associations in music.

          <p class="content-part">
            The participants applied their learned knowledge from the workshop
            by playing the evening concert together with Latino, in the full
            Klub 27 in the Pavarotti Music Center, in front of a large audience
            that supported them with thunderous applause! The energy and
            atmosphere of joint music-making of students from all parts of the
            world on our small stage were truly memorable.

              At the end of the workshop, we spoke with Francisco Angelo Blanco
              Latino, who sent important messages to the participants of the
              workshop, as well as to all other young musicians.

              How it was for you to work with young musicians, Mostar Rock
              School students, and UWC students?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer">
              I didn’t know the level of playing skills they possess, and I was
              really surprised to see how high the level was. I was glad to see
              that they are young musicians with a lot of energy and a desire to
              learn. It was a wonderful experience for me to work with them.
              What I can point out is that I have seen that there is room for
              additional practice and learning improvisation, which is a common
              occurrence in places where I have held workshops. This is quite
              normal because jazz is not music that can be heard and learned at
              every corner, as is often the case for some other genres. What I
              especially liked was seeing students from different schools united
              in making music, with the same motivation – making music. I don't
              know if they have the opportunity to play music together, but I
              will be happy if they managed to do it this time thanks to my
              visit and this workshop.

              Do you think it’s important for young musicians to study jazz as a
              genre? Why?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer">
              I believe that jazz as a genre, as a musical language, should be
              mandatory everywhere, i.e. included in the curriculum in all music
              schools. In modern genres it is necessary and useful to know the
              language of jazz; in the foreground for practicing creativity and
              improvisation. What is especially valuable in jazz is its
              inclusiveness; it can be merged with different music and cultures
              of the world. That’s how we create fusion genres of flamenco jazz,
              Hindu jazz, and many others. Jazz is also democratic music – every
              player can contribute equally. Also, it is not enough just to know
              how to read the score – it is necessary to learn the art of
              improvisation.

              Do you have any advice on how music schools could contribute to
              the development of the jazz scene in Mostar and beyond?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer">
              In the small place I come from, Sedaví, there was no jazz school.
              With my initiative, I brought jazz teachers and musicians from
              other places and other countries to teach and play with local
              musicians. It’s one of the ways I believe it would contribute to
              the development of the jazz scene. Also, one way is to organize a
              Jazz Festival, and invite jazz musicians from other places to
              perform if there are no available jazz musicians where the
              festival is organized. If there are no jazz musicians today, it
              doesn’t mean that they won’t appear tomorrow, because potential
              future jazzers will have the opportunity to attend concerts that
              they will like, and that will encourage them to play and study
              jazz. Finally, the promotion of jazz concerts and educational
              activities is essential.
