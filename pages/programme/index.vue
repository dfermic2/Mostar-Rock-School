                The heart of Rock School Mostar is an educational/teaching
                program that has been held cyclically since 2012 from the
                beginning of September to the beginning of June and which in
                recent years has been attended by between 200 and 250
                participants per year. The students of Rock School Mostar come
                from 10 countries around the world.

            <p>
              In addition to instruments/departments, the teaching program is
              also divided into individual and group teaching, where each
              lecturer creates an author's curriculum and program for both types
              of teaching adapted to each student and group. Classes are based
              on improving technical playing, rhythmicity, harmonization, music
              theory, and the first steps of pairing different
              instruments/vocals, which is a prerequisite for playing in a band
              or orchestra. The eight rooms of the Rock School Mostar are fully
              equipped with all the necessary means for musical education and
              creative work. Instruments, loudspeaker, computer, Smart TV. Some
              of the rooms are specified only for certain classes, e.g. lessons
              for vocals, guitar, keyboards... Rock school Mostar implements
              over 8900 hours of teaching program and over 3000 hours of
              independent and group exercises during one school year.

                  During the school year, Rock School Mostar forms over 70 band
                  formations with over 150 participants gets the opportunity to
                  be a member of the band and through cooperation and creativity
                  build character, knowledge and experience. These bands are
                  what we call "classes" in classical education.
                </p>
              </strong>
              <p>
                What makes this program unique is the mixing of band members
                through 5 cycles a year, where each the formation has 40 days to
                meet, exchange knowledge and experience, research a certain
                musical decade or genre, and creating at least one author's
                work. The crown of every cycle of the Session band program is a
                public concert, which is organised 5 times a year in cooperation
                with partner organisations / institutions in Mostar. At every
                program concert, which is free for visitors, 10-15 band
                formations are presented.
              </p>
              <p>Attendance at program concerts is 1800+ visitors per year.</p>
              <p>
                The bands that have the most interesting musical creations,
                according to the lecturer's evaluations, record their works
                studio, and therefore go through education in the field of audio
                production. The recordings become an eternal bond between these
                young people, while social networks and local radio stations
                provide opportunities for songs reach a wider audience. During
                one school year, more than 1000 hours of sessions of the program
                are held.
